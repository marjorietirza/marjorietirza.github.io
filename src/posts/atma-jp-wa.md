summary:
  - In response to analytics highlighting issues with transaction duplicates and complaints, as a Product Designer, I embarked on a transformative project aimed at improving information clarity. A rapid product launch within two months, marked by shortened transaction times and a notable reduction in complaints. This project not only optimized operations but also fostered cross-functional collaboration among product managers, operational teams, and customer service representatives, cementing relationships beyond traditional product roles.

## Overview  
As part of the design team at Atma, I contributed to the creation of a web dashboard that enables recruiters to manage job postings and applicants efficiently. This dashboard was an extension of our existing mobile app, designed to offer a more comprehensive view of candidates and streamline the hiring process.  

## The Goal  
The objective was to provide recruiters and job providers with a seamless hiring experience on a larger screen. Recruiters using our mobile app had expressed the need to view multiple candidates at once and compare them more effectively. The web dashboard was our response to these needs, designed to replicate the mobile experience while optimizing it for desktop use.

## Research & Insights  
Due to time constraints, we relied primarily on competitive benchmarking rather than direct user research. We analyzed platforms like **Jobstreet, Kitalulus, Glints, and Lumina** to understand common UI/UX patterns in recruiter dashboards.  

However, our most valuable insights came from mobile app feedback—recruiters wanted a **more holistic view of candidates**, rather than managing them one by one on a smaller screen.

## Design Approach  

### 1. Mimicking the Mobile App Experience  
Since many of our users were already familiar with our mobile platform, we aimed to create a dashboard that felt intuitive while leveraging the benefits of a larger screen. Some key modifications included:  
- A structured **navigation bar** optimized for desktop use.  
- Improved **candidate listing layouts** to allow recruiters to compare applicants at a glance.  
- Adjustments to **job listing displays** to accommodate monetization features introduced later.

### 2. Responsiveness: A Shifting Priority  
Initially, responsiveness was deprioritized in favor of speed—leadership wanted to launch the dashboard quickly. However, by late 2024, demand for a responsive experience grew significantly. Recruiters wanted access to the dashboard on **tablets and mobile devices**, especially Apple users who couldn’t download our Android app.  

This prompted a shift in priorities, leading to a late-stage focus on adapting the dashboard for different screen sizes.

### 3. Iterative Improvements Based on User Feedback  
Since recruiters using the web dashboard were **paying users**, their feedback heavily influenced our iterations. We gathered insights through multiple channels:  
- **Onboarding sessions** where new users shared first impressions.  
- **Customer service reports** highlighting pain points and usability issues.  
- **Internal testing** where designers acted as recruiters to simulate real-world scenarios.  

Almost every iteration was informed by direct user feedback, ensuring that we addressed real recruiter needs rather than designing in isolation.

## Key Challenges & Solutions  

### 1. Complexity of the Job Listing Page  
One of the most challenging aspects of the design was the **Job Listing Page**. Recruiters needed an intuitive way to:  
- **Create job postings effortlessly.**  
- **Manage changes** to job listings, especially after we introduced monetization features.  
- Ensure **job postings remained searchable** and easy to filter.  

This required multiple iterations to refine how job cards were displayed, how statuses were communicated, and how filtering systems were structured for better usability.  


### 2. Balancing Speed vs. Scalability  
With leadership pushing for a fast release, we had to prioritize which features made it into the initial launch. This meant deferring certain UX improvements—like full responsiveness—until later.  

However, this trade-off created technical challenges down the line, as adapting a fully evolved product for responsiveness required significantly more effort than if it had been considered from the start.  


## Tools & Collaboration  
- **Figma** for design and prototyping.  
- **Notion** for project tracking and discussions.  
- **Slack** for cross-functional communication.  
- **Cross-team collaboration** with engineers, product managers, and operations.  

I worked alongside another designer, multiple product managers, and web engineers, iterating on features like the **Job Page, Job Creation, KYC process, candidate screening, Virtual Job Fairs, and monetization flow**.  

While the project officially launched in **2023**, continuous improvements were made well into **late 2024**.

## Key Learnings & Reflections  
- **Iterative design is crucial**—real user feedback shaped nearly every improvement.  
- **Prioritizing responsiveness from the start** would have saved significant effort later.  
- **Balancing speed with long-term usability** is challenging; sometimes, deprioritizing UX considerations can lead to greater technical debt.  

## Final Thoughts  
This project highlighted the complexities of designing for recruiters, especially when transitioning from a mobile-first approach to a full web experience. While the dashboard was simple and clean compared to competitors, its true strength came from usability improvements based on direct user feedback.  

If given more time, I would push for prioritizing **responsiveness earlier in the process**, ensuring key functionalities were optimized across all devices from the start.
