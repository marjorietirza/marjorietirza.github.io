summary:
  - In response to analytics highlighting issues with transaction duplicates and complaints, as a Product Designer, I embarked on a transformative project aimed at improving information clarity. A rapid product launch within two months, marked by shortened transaction times and a notable reduction in complaints. This project not only optimized operations but also fostered cross-functional collaboration among product managers, operational teams, and customer service representatives, cementing relationships beyond traditional product roles.

## Overview  
As part of the design team at Atma, I contributed to the creation of a web dashboard that enables recruiters to manage job postings and applicants efficiently. This dashboard was an extension of our existing mobile app, designed to offer a more comprehensive view of candidates and streamline the hiring process.  

---

## Who I Designed This For  
This web dashboard was designed for:  
- **Recruiters & hiring managers** who needed a **larger-screen experience** to view, compare, and manage applicants efficiently.  
- **Existing Atma mobile app users** who wanted a **seamless transition** from mobile to web for enhanced usability.  
- **Operations & customer service teams** who assist recruiters in hiring journey.

## The Goal  
The objective was to provide recruiters and job providers with a seamless hiring experience on a larger screen. Recruiters using our mobile app had expressed the need to view multiple candidates at once and compare them more effectively. The web dashboard was our response to these needs, designed to replicate the mobile experience while optimizing it for desktop use.

## Research & Insights  

### When I Did Research & The Result  
Due to time constraints, we primarily relied on:  
1. **Competitive benchmarking** â€“ We analyzed platforms like **Jobstreet, Kitalulus, Glints, and Lumina** to understand recruiter dashboard UX/UI patterns.  
2. **Mobile app feedback & recruiter insights** â€“ Many recruiters using our mobile app reported:  
   - Frustration in managing candidates one-by-one.  
   - A need for **better filtering and comparison tools**.  
   - Preference for a **desktop-friendly interface** for managing multiple postings efficiently.  

**Key Research Findings â†’ Design Solutions:**  
âœ… **Recruiters needed bulk management tools** â†’ Introduced **multi-select actions** for reviewing and managing applicants.  
âœ… **Candidate comparison was a priority** â†’ Designed a **list-based layout** allowing recruiters to compare multiple profiles at once.  
âœ… **Job posting & management complexity** â†’ Created **clearer job status indicators** to help recruiters track posting activity.

## Design Approach  

### 1. Mimicking the Mobile App Experience  
Since many of our users were already familiar with our mobile platform, we aimed to create a dashboard that felt intuitive while leveraging the benefits of a larger screen. Some key modifications included:  
- A structured **navigation bar** optimized for desktop use.  
- Improved **candidate listing layouts** to allow recruiters to compare applicants at a glance.  
- Adjustments to **job listing displays** to accommodate monetization features introduced later.

### 2. Responsiveness: A Shifting Priority  
Initially, responsiveness was deprioritized in favor of speedâ€”leadership wanted to launch the dashboard quickly. However, by late 2024, demand for a responsive experience grew significantly. Recruiters wanted access to the dashboard on **tablets and mobile devices**, especially Apple users who couldnâ€™t download our Android app.  

This prompted a shift in priorities, leading to a late-stage focus on adapting the dashboard for different screen sizes.

## Iterations & Process  

### **Iteration 1: Initial MVP Release**  
- **Goal:** Deliver a **fast, functional** web experience mirroring the mobile app.  
- **Key trade-off:** **Responsiveness was deprioritized** to meet deadlines.  
- **Outcome:** Recruiters could **view and manage candidates efficiently**, but usability was limited on tablets/mobile.  

### **Iteration 2: Recruiter Feedback & Feature Expansion**  
- **Collected insights from:**  
  - **Onboarding sessions** (first impressions from new users).  
  - **Customer service reports** (highlighting usability pain points).  
  - **Internal testing** (where designers simulated real recruiter workflows).  
- **Changes:**  
  âœ… **Improved applicant filtering & bulk actions.**  
  âœ… **Refined job listing displays** for clarity.  
  âœ… **Introduced monetization elements** (job boosting & premium features).  

### **Iteration 3: Addressing Responsiveness Needs**  
- **Problem:** Demand for **tablet & mobile access** increased.  
- **Solution:** Designed an adaptive layout allowing key functionalities across screen sizes.  
- **Outcome:** By **late 2024**, the dashboard was fully responsive, improving accessibility for all users.

## Key Challenges & Solutions  

### 1. Complexity of the Job Listing Page  
One of the most challenging aspects of the design was the **Job Listing Page**. Recruiters needed an intuitive way to:  
- **Create job postings effortlessly.**  
- **Manage changes** to job listings, especially after we introduced monetization features.  
- Ensure **job postings remained searchable** and easy to filter.  

**Solution:**  
ðŸ”¹ **Redesigned job creation flow** â†’ Step-by-step process to improve clarity.  
ðŸ”¹ **Introduced job status indicators** â†’ Ensured recruiters could track active, pending, or expired listings.  
ðŸ”¹ **Refined filtering & search functions** â†’ Allowed better visibility across multiple listings.  

---

### 2. Balancing Speed vs. Scalability  
With leadership pushing for a fast release, we had to prioritize which features made it into the initial launch. This meant deferring certain UX improvementsâ€”like full responsivenessâ€”until later.  

However, this trade-off created technical challenges down the line, as adapting a fully evolved product for responsiveness required significantly more effort than if it had been considered from the start.  

---

## Tools & Collaboration  
- **Figma** for design and prototyping.  
- **Notion** for project tracking and discussions.  
- **Slack** for cross-functional communication.  
- **Collaboration with engineers, product managers, and operations.**  

I worked alongside another designer, multiple product managers, and web engineers, iterating on features like the **Job Page, Job Creation, KYC process, candidate screening, Virtual Job Fairs, and monetization flow**.  

While the project officially launched in **2023**, continuous improvements were made well into **late 2024**.

## Key Learnings & Reflections  

### What Went Well  
âœ… **Iterative design was crucial** â€“ Real user feedback shaped nearly every improvement.  
âœ… **MVP-first approach worked** â€“ We delivered a functional web dashboard fast.  
âœ… **Recruiters benefited from bulk actions & better filtering** â€“ Improving usability dramatically.  

### What Could Have Been Improved  
ðŸ”¹ **Prioritizing responsiveness earlier** â€“ Would have saved significant effort later.  
ðŸ”¹ **More upfront research on recruiter workflows** â€“ Could have informed better navigation structures.  
ðŸ”¹ **Balancing speed with long-term usability** â€“ Some trade-offs led to technical debt.

## Final Thoughts  
This project highlighted the complexities of designing for recruiters, especially when transitioning from a mobile-first approach to a full web experience. While the dashboard was simple and clean compared to competitors, its true strength came from usability improvements based on direct user feedback.  

ðŸ“Œ **Next Steps:** If given more time, I would push for prioritizing **responsiveness earlier in the process**, ensuring key functionalities were optimized across all devices from the start.
