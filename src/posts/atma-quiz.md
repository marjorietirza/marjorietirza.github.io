summary:
  - In response to analytics highlighting issues with transaction duplicates and complaints, as a Product Designer, I embarked on a transformative project aimed at improving information clarity. A rapid product launch within two months, marked by shortened transaction times and a notable reduction in complaints. This project not only optimized operations but also fostered cross-functional collaboration among product managers, operational teams, and customer service representatives, cementing relationships beyond traditional product roles.

## Overview

As the **sole product designer**, I led the transformation of **Kurma**, a seasonal Ramadan quiz game, into a **structured CPNS/BUMN test preparation platform**. Collaborating with a **lead graphic designer**, I focused on UX/UI while they refined the visuals. The goal was to **extend Kurmaâ€™s engagement mechanics** into a **year-round educational tool**, making test prep **interactive, competitive, and accessible on mobile**.

The result? **More than 20,000 users** participated in the CPNS/BUMN quizâ€”**nearly double** Kurmaâ€™s original user base.

## 1. Understanding the Challenge

### Who I Designed This For  
This platform was built for:  
- **CPNS & BUMN test-takers** who need an **engaging, structured, and gamified way** to prepare for highly competitive exams - who might look for jobs while waiting for or after receiving the result.  
- **Atma app users** who already enjoyed the platform.  
- **Growth stakeholders** who wanted a new pool to acquire users.  

### When I Did Research & The Result  

Research was conducted **before the redesign** to validate user needs:  

1. **Interviews with successful CPNS/BUMN applicants** to understand:  
   - **Test structure** (timing, question distribution).  
   - **Common challenges** (e.g., lack of structured practice, engagement drop-off).  
   - **Preferred study habits** (gamification, ranking systems, progress tracking).  

2. **Data analysis from Kurmaâ€™s user behavior** showed:  
   - **Users spent 2.3x longer per session** when engaged in gamified quizzes.  
   - **Leaderboard visibility increased return sessions**.  

These insights guided design decisions for **retaining engagement while introducing structured test preparation**.  

### Problem Statement  

> ##### "How might we create an engaging and scalable CPNS/BUMN preparation platform?"

### How the Research Result Impacts Design Decisions  

**Key Research Findings â†’ Direct Design Solutions:**  
âœ… **Test-Taking Structure Matters** â†’ Implemented **real exam format**, including **section-based quizzes** and **scoring mirroring the real test**.  
âœ… **Leaderboard Increases Retention** â†’ Improved **leaderboard ranking logic**, ensuring it **reflects real test scores**.  
âœ… **Gamification Drives Engagement** â†’ Integrated **points, ranking system, and competitive incentives**.  
âœ… **Users Prefer Mobile-Only Study Tools** â†’ Optimized UI for **small screens, one-hand navigation**.

## 2. Designing the Solution

### Feature Set & Gamification  

The new app retained **Kurmaâ€™s intuitive navigation** while adding test prep elements:

âœ… **Quizzes** structured like the real CPNS/BUMN tests  
âœ… **Leaderboard System**: Motivates users by ranking scores.  
âœ… **Points-Based Scoring**: +5 points for correct answers (mirroring the real test).  
âœ… **Learn Module**: Aggregates CPNS/BUMN-related articles.  
âœ… **Test Resumption**: Users can pause and continue their test anytime.

### Adapting the Leaderboard  

One of the main design challenges was **reformatting Kurmaâ€™s leaderboard** to fit **CPNS/BUMN ranking structures**, ensuring it accurately reflected **test completion and score progression**.

## 3. Iterations & Process  

The design went through multiple iterations:  

### **Iteration 1: Initial Wireframes**  
- Focused on **migrating Kurmaâ€™s gamification to a structured test format**.  
- **Challenge:** Early wireframes didnâ€™t fully capture **test-taking anxiety**â€”needed a **realistic time-based experience**.  
- **Solution:** Added a **timer and section-based breakdown**.

### **Iteration 2: User Flow Adjustments**  
- **Challenge:** Users needed an **easy way to resume tests**.  
- **Solution:** Introduced a **pause & resume feature**, allowing users to continue where they left off.

### **Iteration 3: Leaderboard Refinements**  
- **Challenge:** The **initial leaderboard** didnâ€™t differentiate between **partial and fully completed tests**.  
- **Solution:** Adjusted ranking logic to **prioritize complete test scores** over fragmented attempts.

### **Final Design Implementation**  
- Optimized **touch targets and navigation** for mobile users.  
- **Finalized leaderboard UI** with **progress visibility** to enhance engagement.

## 4. UX/UI Considerations  

### Mobile-First Optimization  

- **Small-Screen Adaptability**: Since it's mobile-only, layouts were designed for **smaller screens**, ensuring easy readability.  
- **Quick Navigation**: A **Floating Action Button (FAB)** allows users to start tests immediately.  

### Time Constraints & Trade-Offs  

Due to an extremely **short timeline**, no usability testing was conducted before launch. However, I focused on:  

- **Keeping test-taking structured yet flexible** (allowing pauses/resumptions).  
- **Ensuring leaderboard visibility** (easy access motivates competition).  
- **Prioritizing core test-taking features** over additional gamification mechanics.

## 5. Measuring Success  

Since the app was a seasonal release, impact was measured by:  

ðŸ“ˆ **Engagement Metrics**  
- Number of users who started quizzes  
- Test completion rate  
- Average questions answered per session  
- Number of users who climbed the leaderboard  

> **More than 20,000 users** participated (compared to Kurmaâ€™s **13,000+ users**).

## 6. Lessons Learned & Future Improvements  

### Key Takeaways  

- **Leaderboards drive competition**: A simple, easy-to-access leaderboard significantly increased motivation.  
- **Mobile-first design is crucial**: Ensuring tests fit small screens improved usability.  

### What Iâ€™d Improve  

- **Better Navigation for Test-Takers**: Adding the ability to **move between questions before final submission**â€”similar to **IELTS answer sheets**â€”would enhance the experience.  
- **More User Testing**: Given more time, Iâ€™d conduct usability tests before launch.

## 7. Final Outcome  

The CPNS/BUMN app successfully transformed **Kurma** into a **highly engaging test prep platform**, proving that **gamification + structured learning = increased retention**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Next Steps**: Future iterations could include **adaptive learning paths, detailed analytics, and mock exams** to further improve learning outcomes.
