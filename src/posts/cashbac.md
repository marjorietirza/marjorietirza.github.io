summary:
  - In response to analytics highlighting issues with transaction duplicates and complaints, as a Product Designer, I embarked on a transformative project aimed at improving information clarity. A rapid product launch within two months, marked by shortened transaction times and a notable reduction in complaints. This project not only optimized operations but also fostered cross-functional collaboration among product managers, operational teams, and customer service representatives, cementing relationships beyond traditional product roles.

## Background

Back in 2021, as the sole designer for the Cashbac Biz app, I was tasked with improving the “On-going Transaction” page. The task stemmed from a surge in complaints about:

1. **Failed transactions** by customers.
2. **Failed bill distribution**, which caused merchants to create multiple (duplicated) bills for a single transaction.

### My Role

As a Product Designer, my main goal was to reduce these complaints and streamline operations through design. This required digging deep into the problem and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

## Understanding the Problem

| Class                    | Gray scale |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| `prose-gray` _(default)_ | Gray       |
| `prose-slate`            | Slate      |
| `prose-zinc`             | Zinc       |
| `prose-neutral`          | Neutral    |
| `prose-stone`            | Stone      |

> Always include the `prose` class when adding a gray scale modifier

### Observation and Research

To fully grasp the issue, I collaborated with the **Field Operations (FO) team manager** and conducted an observation study. This included:

- Speaking with merchants to understand their pain points.
- Observing how transaction information was being handled.
- Measuring merchants' understanding of the transaction process.

### Root Cause Analysis

> **Warning:** SOME NOTES HERE.

After gathering insights, we identified several key issues:

- **Language barrier:** The uncommon terms used in the app created confusion.
- **Process gaps:** There was no clear prioritization or clarity in the information hierarchy.

### Competitor Benchmarking

To strengthen our findings, we analyzed competitor apps to understand how they addressed similar problems.

## From Research to Design

### Making Sense of the Data

The collected data was analyzed and used to craft survey questions for our merchants. While surveys provided quantitative data, I believe **quick interviews** with cashiers would have added valuable qualitative insights.

### Design Process

The new design focused on improving:

1. **Clarity**: Simplified the information displayed on the “On-going Transaction” page.
2. **Usability**: Enhanced the overall flow to reduce confusion.
3. **Error prevention**: Introduced features to avoid duplicate transactions.

## Implementation and Outcome

### Fast Turnaround

The project timeline was tight—only two months from request to product launch. Despite the constraints, the results were impactful:

- **Reduced complaints**: The clarity improvements led to a notable drop in customer complaints.
- **Shortened transaction times**: Merchants processed transactions faster.

### Retrospective

Reflecting on the project, I learned several key lessons:

1. **Event tracking matters**: Proper analytics would have reduced the need for extensive surveys.
2. **User involvement is crucial**: Including users during design iterations would have minimized post-release adjustments.

If I could redo this project, I would:

- Conduct **interviews instead of surveys** to gather richer insights.
- Involve users earlier in the design process and validate with usability testing.

## Final Thoughts

This project highlighted the importance of listening to users and collaborating with cross-functional teams. By addressing user pain points directly, we not only improved the product but also strengthened relationships with merchants.
