summary:
  - In response to analytics highlighting issues with transaction duplicates and complaints, as a Product Designer, I embarked on a transformative project aimed at improving information clarity. A rapid product launch within two months, marked by shortened transaction times and a notable reduction in complaints. This project not only optimized operations but also fostered cross-functional collaboration among product managers, operational teams, and customer service representatives, cementing relationships beyond traditional product roles.

## Overview  
Pluang's community chats were previously managed on **Telegram**, making it difficult to moderate discussions, enforce guidelines, and manage users effectively. To address these challenges, we designed an **internal dashboard** that allows Pluang's admins and product managers to **moderate messages, manage community members, and ensure discussions remain safe, informative, and aligned with community guidelines**.  

---

## Who I Designed This For  
This dashboard was specifically designed for:  
- **Pluang‚Äôs internal admins and product managers** who act as community moderators and need structured tools for chat management,require better tracking and reporting of community violations.  
- **Community members** who benefit from improved moderation, ensuring discussions remain **safe, relevant, and free of spam or violations**.

## Problem Statement  
Before this dashboard, Pluang‚Äôs **community chats lacked proper management tools**, leading to inefficiencies:  
- **No in-house moderation**‚Äîadmins had to manually scroll through Telegram chats.  
- **No structured way to manage users or messages**, making it difficult to track violations.  
- **No centralized tool**‚Äîeverything was handled through external platforms without integration.  

The goal was to **bring all moderation tasks into one dashboard**, streamlining the process for internal admins and product managers acting as community moderators.   

---

## Design Goals  
The dashboard was built to:  
- ‚úÖ **Provide structured community management**‚Äîallowing admins to moderate messages, manage members, and enforce guidelines efficiently.  
- ‚úÖ **Ensure safe and informative discussions** by integrating **moderation tools** and **username reservations**.  
- ‚úÖ **Reduce reliance on third-party platforms** (like Telegram) and bring chat management **in-house** for better control.

## Research & Feedback Loop  

### When I Did Research & The Result  
The research for this project was conducted in two phases:  
1. **Internal stakeholder interviews** ‚Äì We gathered pain points from **admins and product managers** who manually moderated Telegram chats.  
2. **Iterative feedback** ‚Äì Instead of conducting large-scale external research, this project relied on **real-world usage feedback** from internal teams.  

**Key Research Findings:**  
- **Admins needed better message filtering** ‚Äì Manually searching through chat logs was inefficient.  
- **User management was challenging** ‚Äì There was no easy way to track rule violators.  
- **Moderators wanted automation** ‚Äì Certain flagged content should be automatically surfaced.  

This research directly informed the design of the **dashboard‚Äôs core features**.  

---

## How the Research Result Impacts Design Decisions  

Based on the research findings, several design choices were made:  
1. **Message filtering & flagging** ‚Äì Instead of forcing moderators to scroll through entire chat histories, the dashboard allows **real-time filtering and flagging** of messages.  
2. **Centralized user management** ‚Äì A dedicated **User Management Panel** lets admins track violations, apply penalties, and manage member roles.  
3. **Username reservation system** ‚Äì Since username conflicts were common, a **reservation system** was introduced to prevent duplicates and ensure verified users received priority.  

These decisions made **moderation tasks faster, more structured, and easier to scale**.

## Iterations & Process  

The design evolved through several **iteration rounds**, incorporating real-time feedback from Pluang‚Äôs internal teams:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Initial Concept & Wireframes**  
   - **Problem:** How do we bring all community moderation into one place?  
   - **Solution:** Wireframed a **basic dashboard** that included separate tabs for **messages, users, and reports**.  
   - **Feedback:** Stakeholders wanted a **simpler UI**, as the initial design felt too technical.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Prototype & Usability Testing**  
   - **Tested** the prototype with **Pluang‚Äôs product managers and admins**.  
   - Adjusted **button placements and navigation** based on moderator workflow feedback.  
   - **Simplified filters** for better usability.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **High-Fidelity Design & Iterations**  
   - Incorporated **structured hierarchy** for message review.  
   - Implemented **username reservation tracking** based on admin requests.  
   - Finalized **real-time moderation features**.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Adjustments & Release**  
   - Optimized UI for **faster interactions**.  
   - **Ensured full integration** with Pluang‚Äôs backend for smooth data retrieval.

## Key Challenges & Design Solutions  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Managing Complex Information in One Dashboard**  
Handling **messages, users, and reports in one interface** was a challenge. To simplify this:  
- The UI was **segmented into clear sections** for message moderation, member management, and username reservations.  
- A structured **hierarchy of controls** helped admins **quickly navigate between tasks**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Introducing Username Reservations**  
A unique feature was **username reservations**, which was **uncommon in typical moderation dashboards**.  
- Admins could **reserve usernames linked to emails/phone numbers** for verified members.  
- A system was built to **prevent offensive usernames or duplicates**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Transitioning from Telegram to an In-House System**  
Previously, moderation required **scrolling through Telegram messages manually**. The dashboard improved this by:  
- ‚úÖ Allowing **real-time message filtering & flagging**.  
- ‚úÖ Centralizing all moderation actions in **one interface** instead of navigating multiple chat threads.

## Impact & Results  

While there were **no measurable KPIs** post-launch, the new dashboard significantly improved workflow efficiency:  
- ‚úÖ **All moderation tools are now in one place**‚Äîno need to manually browse chat logs.  
- ‚úÖ **Violations are trackable and manageable**‚Äîadmins can now respond through the dashboard.  
- ‚úÖ **Faster response time to community issues**, as reports and flagged content are clearly surfaced.

## Lessons Learned & Future Improvements  
üîπ **Testing with actual admins & moderators** ‚Äì If given more time, gathering **real-world feedback** would help refine usability.  
üîπ **Potential automation features** ‚Äì Such as **auto-flagging** for certain violations to reduce manual work.  
üîπ **Enhanced analytics** ‚Äì Tracking common violations and user behaviors over time.

## Final Thoughts  
This project successfully **brought Pluang‚Äôs community moderation in-house**, eliminating the inefficiencies of external chat management. While basic moderation tools were the foundation, features like **username reservations and structured reporting** made this dashboard a valuable **long-term solution for scaling Pluang‚Äôs community engagement**.
