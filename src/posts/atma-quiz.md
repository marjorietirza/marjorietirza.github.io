summary:
  - In response to analytics highlighting issues with transaction duplicates and complaints, as a Product Designer, I embarked on a transformative project aimed at improving information clarity. A rapid product launch within two months, marked by shortened transaction times and a notable reduction in complaints. This project not only optimized operations but also fostered cross-functional collaboration among product managers, operational teams, and customer service representatives, cementing relationships beyond traditional product roles.

## Overview

As the **sole product designer**, I led the transformation of **Kurma**, a seasonal Ramadan quiz game, into a **structured CPNS/BUMN test preparation platform**. Collaborating with a **lead graphic designer**, I focused on UX/UI while they refined the visuals. The goal was to **extend Kurmaâ€™s engagement mechanics** into a **year-round educational tool**, making test prep **interactive, competitive, and accessible on mobile**.

The result? **More than 20,000 users** participated in the CPNS/BUMN quizâ€”**nearly double** Kurmaâ€™s original user base.

## 1. Understanding the Challenge

### Problem Statement

> ##### "How might we create an engaging and scalable CPNS/BUMN preparation platform?"

### Key Insights

- **Real Exam Structure Matters**  
  I interviewed friends who passed the CPNS/BUMN exams to **understand the test format, scoring system, and study pain points**.
- **Gamification Works**  
  Kurma had proven engagement, with a **2.3x increase in session time per user/day**.
- **Mobile-Only Experience**  
  Since the app was mobile-only, all designs needed to be **optimized for smaller screens**.

## 2. Designing the Solution

### Feature Set & Gamification

The new app retained **Kurmaâ€™s intuitive navigation** while adding test prep elements:

âœ… **Quizzes** structured like the real CPNS/BUMN tests

âœ… **Leaderboard System**: Motivates users by ranking scores.

âœ… **Points-Based Scoring**: +5 points for correct answers (mirroring the real test).

âœ… **Learn Module**: Aggregates CPNS/BUMN-related articles.

âœ… **Test Resumption**: Users can pause and continue their test anytime.

### Adapting the Leaderboard

One of the main design challenges was **reformatting Kurmaâ€™s leaderboard** to fit **CPNS/BUMN ranking structures**, ensuring it accurately reflected **test completion and score progression**.

## 3. UX/UI Considerations

### Mobile-First Optimization

- **Small-Screen Adaptability**: Since it's mobile-only, layouts were designed for **smaller screens**, ensuring easy readability.
- **Quick Navigation**: A **Floating Action Button (FAB)** allows users to start tests immediately.

### Time Constraints & Trade-Offs

Due to an extremely **short timeline**, no usability testing was conducted before launch. However, I focused on:

- **Keeping test-taking structured yet flexible** (allowing pauses/resumptions).
- **Ensuring leaderboard visibility** (easy access motivates competition).
- **Prioritizing core test-taking features** over additional gamification mechanics.

## 4. Measuring Success

Since the app was a seasonal release, impact was measured by:

ðŸ“ˆ **Engagement Metrics**

- Number of users who started quizzes
- Test completion rate
- Average questions answered per session
- Number of users who climbed the leaderboard

> **More than 20,000 users** participated (compared to Kurmaâ€™s **13,000+ users**).

## 5. Lessons Learned & Future Improvements

### Key Takeaways

- **Leaderboards drive competition**: A simple, easy-to-access leaderboard significantly increased motivation.
- **Mobile-first design is crucial**: Ensuring tests fit small screens improved usability.

### What Iâ€™d Improve

- **Better Navigation for Test-Takers**: Adding the ability to **move between questions before final submission**â€”similar to **IELTS answer sheets**â€”would enhance the experience.
- **More User Testing**: Given more time, Iâ€™d conduct usability tests before launch.

## 6. Final Outcome

The CPNS/BUMN app successfully transformed **Kurma** into a **highly engaging test prep platform**, proving that **gamification + structured learning = increased retention**.

ðŸ“Œ **Next Steps**: Future iterations could include **adaptive learning paths, detailed analytics, and mock exams** to further improve learning outcomes.
