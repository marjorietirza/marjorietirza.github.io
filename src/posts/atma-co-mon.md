summary:
  - In response to analytics highlighting issues with transaction duplicates and complaints, as a Product Designer, I embarked on a transformative project aimed at improving information clarity. A rapid product launch within two months, marked by shortened transaction times and a notable reduction in complaints. This project not only optimized operations but also fostered cross-functional collaboration among product managers, operational teams, and customer service representatives, cementing relationships beyond traditional product roles.

## Background  

The business and leadership team needed to **generate revenue** by monetizing platform features, specifically for **Job Providers (JPs)** using the **JP Mobile App and JP Web App**.  

The challenge was twofold:  

1. **No existing payment system** â€“ Users couldnâ€™t purchase or access premium features.  
2. **Drop in coin usage** â€“ After removing **job creation monetization**, coin transactions declined significantly, as job postings previously accounted for a large portion of coin usage.  

To address this, the team implemented a **Coin & Payment System** and later introduced **Paid Job Listing Packages** to encourage coin usage and revenue growth.

## Collaboration & Execution  

This project was executed within a **tight deadline**, requiring **close collaboration** between:  

| Team Members             | Role                                                 |  
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |  
| `Product Manager` _(PM)_ | Prioritization and requirement alignment             |  
| `Engineering Leads`      | Ensuring technical feasibility for transaction flows |  
| `Data Analyst`           | Tracking coin usage and conversion rates             |  
| `Operations Team`        | Handling customer support and transaction issues     |  

## My Role & Contributions  

As the **Product Designer** leading the design efforts, I was responsible for:  

- **Mapping out all possible user flows** before starting UI design  
- **Ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience** for purchasing and using coins  
- **Collaborating with the product manager, engineers, data analyst, and operations team** to align business needs with technical feasibility  
- **Managing edge cases for transactions and payments** to ensure a smooth experience  
- **Designing clear package comparisons and communication strategies** for the tiered job listing system

## Version 1: Implementing the Coin & Payment System  

### The Problem  

Without a **Coins & Payment System**, the platform couldnâ€™t monetize key features like:  

- **Candidate search**  
- **Boosting job posts**  
- **Viewing candidate documents & WhatsApp numbers**  
- **Job posting, reactivation, and reposting** (prior to monetization adjustments)  

### The Solution & Design Enhancements  

To enable seamless payments, I designed and optimized:  

#### 1. Multiple Payment Methods  

- Supported **E-wallets, Virtual Accounts, Debit/Credit Cards, and QR codes**  
- Designed **clear step-by-step instructions** for each payment method  
- Handled **transaction flows through a third-party payment provider**  

#### 2. Transaction History & Coin Balance Visibility  

- **Dedicated transaction page** to track top-ups, deductions, and spending  
- **Prominent coin balance display** for easy access

#### 3. Payment Status Handling  

- Success, failure, and pending status pages with **detailed transaction breakdowns**  
- **Customer support integration** for failed transactions

### Business & User Impact  

- âœ… **Enabled monetization** by allowing JPs to purchase and use coins  
- âœ… **Improved transaction success rate**, ensuring a frictionless top-up experience  
- âœ… **Clearer spending insights** through transaction history & balance visibility

## Version 2: Reviving Monetization Through Job Listing Packages  

### The Problem  

After **removing the monetization on job creation**, coin usage dropped. This led to:  

- **Fewer top-ups and lower revenue**  
- **Limited spending on premium features**  

### The Solution & Design Enhancements  

To **reintroduce monetization**, I helped design the **communication and comparison strategy** for a **tiered Paid Job Listing Package System**:  

#### 1. Three Job Listing Packages  

- **Basic** (low-cost, standard visibility)  
- **Premium** (priority placement, better reach)  
- **Premium+** (maximum visibility, featured listing)  

> _Note: I did not design the tier package itself, but I worked on how we communicated the tiers, their differences, and their benefits._  

#### 2. Optimized Job Posting Flow  

- **Clear package comparisons** to highlight benefits  
- **Free quotas** to ease transition from free to paid job listings

#### 3. Cost Visibility & Insufficient Balance Handling  

- A **pricing page** to educate users on premium features  
- **In-app top-up prompts** when users lack enough coins

### Business & User Impact  

- âœ… **Increased coin usage** by giving JPs reasons to spend coins  
- âœ… **Higher retention of paying users** through premium benefits  
- âœ… **Smooth transition from free to paid** with trial quotas

## Final Results  

These implementations **successfully refined the platform's monetization approach**, leading to:  

- ðŸš€ **A scalable revenue model**  
- ðŸ“ˆ **More frequent coin top-ups and purchases** (handled via a third-party service)  
- ðŸ‘Œ **A user-friendly payment & job posting experience**  

With **V2**, job monetization was restructured into **tiered job listing packages**, offering JPs a more flexible and valuable way to boost their visibility. While job creation was no longer directly monetized, this approach ensured a better balance between accessibility and revenue generation.
